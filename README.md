## Purpose
We are fine-tuning and auditing a GPT model (from OpenAI's gpt-4o-mini) designed to assist students with courses. This is an experimental project that is part of our ongoing doctoral research at the Ã‰cole nationale d'administration publique (ENAP). No institution is to be associated with this research at this time. Our published studies can be found here: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aAI6Wf8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao
